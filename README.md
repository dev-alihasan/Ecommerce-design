# E-commerce Product Card

This project is a simple e-commerce product card design. It includes a CSS file for styling, an HTML file for structure, and a JavaScript file for interactivity.

## Project Structure

- `design.css`: This file contains the CSS code for the product card design. It includes styles for the card container, image container, product options, and more.

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file. It defines the structure of the product card, including elements for the product image, title, price, color options, and an "Add to Cart" button.

- `code.js`: This JavaScript file adds interactivity to the product card. It includes functionality for toggling more options, changing the product image, selecting available colors, and liking the product.
